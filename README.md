# Feed Reader Testing: Udacity FEND Project #4 #

Using the **JavaScript** testing framework *Jasmine*, this project required students to write tests to determine  
whether the code was working as intended. Test Suites and attendant _specs_ were written for a series of issues  
outlined 
in the **Udacity** classroom rubric.
